## Introduction

## Initial Data Cleaning


### PSID Data

The script `make_BFM_data`[R/make_BFM_data.R] compiles the (almost) raw PSID data in `data/data-psid` and `data/data-psid` into a panel of marriage and labor supply outcomes for parents (`data/MarriagePanel.csv`) and a panel of child skill and investment outcomes (`data/KidPanelv2.csv`) which are used to construct the moments used when estimating the model as well as the illustrative facts in the paper.

### Other Data
